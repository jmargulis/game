This is a very bare bones React Native app. It was created by running the following command on the terminal and following the prompts.

```
npx create-expo-app --template
```

I chose to use the JavaScript version, which creates an App.js file as the beginning of the application.

## Running
For now, you can run this locally by running the following command: `npm run start`. This should show a QR code and awaits a mobile device scanning it before any code is generated and delivered to the mobile device. In order to run the app on a mobile device you will need to download the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app and choose the **Scan QR code** option. This will load the app on your mobile device and show you a simple message to get started.
